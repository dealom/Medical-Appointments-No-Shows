# Medical-Appointments-No-Shows
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of Medical Appointments to determine what factors could cause patients to miss medical appointments. Dataset: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wm6w2fvkfj/1

(WIP)
In this dataset, 90.2567% of patients went to their scheduled medical appointment. 
Patients are more likely to miss appointments in non-mild weather. When the weather is mild, 91.5517% of patients go to their appointment. The biggest discrepancy between the shows and no-shows is in 'heavy cold' weather where only 85.6662% of patients go to their appointment.

The attendance rate went down overtime from 2016 (96.005%) to 2022 (82.8025%).

Attendance is slightly increased during no rain (90.4417%). During heavy rain, it drops to 89.5254%.

Males (90.4425%) are more likely to show up to appointments than female (89.6692%).
